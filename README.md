# Custom Content
This section is for modders who would like to create a custom scope overlay.

The process is simple.
Create a vector based image such as `.svg` or `.ai` for your scope overlay.
Then import your vector image into new flash file (`.fla`), publish the `.swf` to a directory that matches a valid weapon scope object modification. Thats it!


## Notes
With this system a single physical (`.nif`) representation of a scope is paired with a single visual (`.swf`) representation of a scope. A unquie resource identifier for the `.swf` file path is derived from the omod's world model path.
Your scope omod must also add the `HasScope` keyword to a weapon via its property modifiers.
If your scope omod model is `Meshes\Weapons\44\44Scope.nif` then your scope overlay will be autoloaded from `Interface\Weapons\44\44Scope.swf`. 

* Adobe Illustrator
